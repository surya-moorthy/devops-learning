# Devops Culture and Practices

  ## What is Devops?
   - It is A specific role for the Engineers who is responsible for work on Development side 
     and Operation side.
   - On Development side , the core developers build the features and devops engineers manage and 
     integrate them to the main code with the help of developers.
   - On operations side , QA and IT Teams do operations on the developed code to monitor and log to 
     improve the performance and in here devops engineer work and collaborate with them, to improve 
     the efficiency and performance of the code.

  ## "You Build it,You run it".

  - Increased transparency
  - Communication
  - Collaboration between teams
  - Shared Responsibility

  ## Devops Practices

  ### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

     - Integrate code into a shared repository frequently to detect issues early.
     - Tools : Jenkins , Gitlab CI/CD

  ### 2. Continuous Delivery (CD)

     - Automate the release process so code changes can be deployed to production quickly and safely.
     - Tools : ArgoCD , Jenkins , Gitlab CI/CD

  ### 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

     - Manage infrastructure using code to ensure consistency and repeatability.
     - Tools : Terraform , AWS CloudFormation

  ### 4. Configuration Management
  
     - Automate configuration of servers and environments.
     - Tools : Ansible
  ###  5. Version Control

     - Track and manage changes to code and infrastructure.
     - Tools : Git and GitHub

  ### 6. Monitoring & Logging

     - Monitor applications and infrastructure performance, log events, and set alerts.
     - Tools : Prometheus , Grafana , ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

   ### 7. Containerization
     - Package applications and dependencies into containers for consistency across environments.
     - Tools  : Docker
   ### 8. Orchestration
     - Manage and scale containerized applications. 
     - Tools : Kubernetes , Docker Swarm
