 - Makes the code to have one code at a time , example : Data layer must do the data related job like getting and saving the data.

## Open/Close Principle

  - Use the code as for extension,not for modification.which means when use create a piece of code make sure the code is not modified after published but can be extended by using it.this way we can easily get the factors the previous code too.

## Liskov Substitution Principle 

 - If a type implements an interface, it should be usable anywhere that interface is expected without breaking behavior.

## Interface Segragation Principle

 - Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion

 - high level modules should not depend on low level modules. those modules should be dependent on adstraction.
